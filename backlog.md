### Frontend build — recruiter dashboard (React + TS + Vite)

> Builds the approved refined design (`designs/recruiter-dashboard/` — growth-green, SVG icons, whitespace-first) against the FastAPI backend, in `frontend/`. Ordered foundation-first; each item is independently buildable + verifiable and traces to a design screen or a CLAUDE.md FE convention.

| BL-FE-12 | Polish + states + a11y + responsive — loading/empty/error states, `:focus-visible`, WCAG AA, breakpoints, dark theme; design-agent verify pass | MEDIUM |
| BL-FE-13 | FE Dockerfile + build/deploy (Vite build) + CI | LOW |
